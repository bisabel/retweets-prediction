# Executive Summary/Abstract

Predicting the diffusion of a tweet in time can be a vital tool to react some spreed info. This project tries to build a process to extract tweets and their retweets. To later analyze and build a model that can predict the amount of retweet of a point in the future.

## Files in the project

Only the step exploratory-analysis has done. In the folder with the same name can be found:
* extract-example-retweets.py Print to the console, the date of the each retweets of a given tweet id. It uses the library twitterApi, for install:ies:
* graph-example-retweet.ipynb Generate a grahp using array of dates of retweets collected from the previous script.

## Technologies

 Python 3, libraries: twitterApi
 pip installer,
 Canopy code editor, Python shell and File Browser. libraries: matplotlib, numpy
